# Lab Report 5

I did not attend Lab 7 in person so lab report 4 was hard to start on my own. To do the task, I just tried to read through the lab nd work through the tasks on my own.
Fortunately, most of it was fairly self-explanatory. All the shortcuts I learned were extremely helpful (such as using tab) and I wish I had utilized them more throughout the quarter and on other labs.
If I had done the task by writing a bash script, it would have made things easier in the long run. Although setting up a bash script initially takes takes time, it makes processes faster later on. 
It is especially helpful for cases where you have to run a test case over and over again. Obviously, something that wouldn't be included in the bash script would be the command nano since that's something that only needed to be done once. However if it was an action that would have needed to be repeated multiple times, it would be included in the bash script.
